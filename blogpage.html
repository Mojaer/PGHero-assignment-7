            <h1>1.What is the Difference between map(), filter(), foreach() and find()?</h1>
            <h3>forEach() allows you to execute the same code on each element of an array, however,Â it does not modify
                the array and
                returns undefined. <br>
                map() runs the same code on each element of an array and produces a new array containing the modified
                elements. <br>
                filter() examines each element in an array to determine if it fits a specific criteria and returns a new
                array with the
                elements that return true for the criteria. <br> The find() method delivers the value of the first
                element that satisfies a condition. <br><br> The distinction between the foreach and map() functions is
                The map() method is used to change an array's elements,
                whereas the forEach() method is used to iterate through the array's contents. <br> The difference
                between filter() and find() is filter() returns an array
                containing the element that satisfies the condition,
                but find() returns the element itself
                that satisfies the condition

            <h1>2. What is the difference between local storage and session storage and cookies?</h1>
            <h3>Local storage is important for saving data that a user will require later, including offline data.
                Session storage is an
                excellent method for improving the efficiency of online apps. Cookies are an excellent solution for
                storing data
                that should not be stored for an extended period of time, like session IDs.</h3>

            <h1>3. What is Event loop and how does it work?</h1>
            <h3>The Event Loop is used to keep track of the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack has no
                entries, the
                Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and push it to the Call Stack, where it will be
                executed. In the
                Event Loop, such an iteration is known as a tick.</h3>
